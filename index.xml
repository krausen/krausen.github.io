All you need is a pen and a paper. Optionally have a friend that can receive and decrypt your message, this makes it a lot more fun! The method is called Columnar Transposition. A variant of it, the Double Transposition Cipher have been used as method for securing messages in the World War I &amp;amp; II.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://krausen.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2021 12:24:42 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://krausen.github.io/about/</guid><description>Software developer based in Stockholm, Sweden</description></item><item><title>Simple rules for CI</title><link>https://krausen.github.io/posts/ci_rules/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Aug 2021 15:02:58 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://krausen.github.io/posts/ci_rules/</guid><description>I like the concept of Simple rules. Basically they are 3-5 simple rules on how to deal with a complex problem. This is not magic number but keeping it in that range makes them easy to remember and the constraint forces you to think about the essential and most important rules. They should be followed as a guideline when making decisions rather than followed as an algorithm. In my experience they work well in sticking to a strategy or way of working in a team.</description></item></channel></rss>
