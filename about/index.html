<p>My name is Niclas Krause and I work as a software developer in Stockholm, Sweden. I have a Bachelors degree in Computer science and a broad interest in software and computers.</p>
<p>Working as a Software developer I constantly stumble upon interesting ideas. What captures my interest are ways to building better software, useful technology, best practices, architecture, ways of working. This blog is my attempt to gather the best of that in on place.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p><strong>Learning</strong> Writing about what you learn is one of the best way to test how well you have understood a topic. Your knowledge gaps will get painfully clear when to are trying to formulate an idea in written text. This gives you an opportunity to fill them and progress your learning. Describing an idea in your own words help me to internalize the learning. Making it my own in a way.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing</strong> Much of what you will find here are not my original ideas. I gather awesome ideas from others, in sharing them I hope that others will find them useful as well.</p>
