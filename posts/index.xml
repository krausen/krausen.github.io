Basically they are 3-5 simple rules on how to deal with a complex problem. This is not magic number but keeping it in that range makes them easy to remember and the constraint forces you to think about the essential and most important rules. They should be followed as a guideline when making decisions rather than followed as an algorithm. In my experience they work well in sticking to a strategy or way of working in a team.</description></item></channel></rss>
